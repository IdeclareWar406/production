            <h2>Read the Word of God</h2>
            <h3>Reading the scriptures daily helps us not only become more familiar with them, but also helps our learning and understanding of God and His ways. It also helps us grow to be more Christ like as we are continually reminded that we are not perfect but God has given and saved us by grace through faith in Him.</h3>
            <h2>Prayer</h2>
            <h3>Communicating with God through prayer, whether its asking for direction in life or just like a general conversation. God wants a relationship with His creation and we have a deep need for our relationship with Him. How can any realtionship grow if there is no communication. Prayer is our way of communicating with God and making a more personal relationship with Him.</h3>
            <h2>Worship</h2>
            <h3>Worshipping God together and on your own will grow your relationship with God as you listen and repeat and understand the words of worship being given to The Lord.</h3>
            <h2>Serving with the Body of Christ (the Church)</h2>
            <h3>We grow in service to one another, showing love and kindness to eachother and to all who come.</h3>
            <h2>Giving it back to God</h2>
            <h3>Glorifying our Creator in all that we do, honoring Him by what we do</h3>
            <h2>Live it</h2>
            <h3>Easier said than done, but the best way was never going to be easy. Living it, reflecting Christ as the Apostle Paul told us to reflect him as he reflects Christ, we should strive to reflect Christ into our work and communities on a daily basis</h3>
            <h2>Fasting</h2>
            <h3>Fasting, dedicating the time to the Lord is important. It will help deepen your faith and relationship with God. </h3>

            <h3>"Jesus modeled two types of habits for us:  Being Habits and Doing Habits.  Being habits: solitude, prayer, study of God's Word, the application of Scripture to real life, and supportive relationships - all of which are rooted in and fueled by accepting and abiding in God's love.  Doing habits: grace, forgiveness, encouragement, and community."     - Lead like Jesus</h3>
